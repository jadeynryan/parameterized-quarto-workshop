🗓 June 6, 2023 \| 11:00am - 2:00pm EDT

🏨 Virtual

💥 **FREE** [workshop
registration](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/r-medicine/) with registration for the R/Medicine 2023 meeting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Overview

In this workshop you will learn how to import messy data from an Excel
spreadsheet, and develop the R skills to turn this mess into tidy data
ready for analysis.

## Learning objectives

-   The acquire a foundational understanding of how data should be organized.

-   To import Excel files with (common, messy) data problems.

-   To address and clean common messy data problems in each variable.

-   To address and clean data with more complex meta-problems, like pivoting to long format for data analysis, thickening timestamped data to manageable time units, padding missing dates, and joining different datasets together.

## Is this course for me?

If your answer to any of the following questions is "yes", then this is
the right workshop for you.

-   Do you frequently receive untidy data for analysis in Excel
    spreadsheets?

-   Does this drive you slightly batty?

-   Do you want to learn how to make your life easier with a suite of
    data cleaning tools?

The workshop is designed for those with some experience in R. It will be
assumed that participants can perform basic data manipulation.
Experience with the {tidyverse} and the `%>%`/`|>` operator is a major plus,
but is not required.

## Prework

This workshop will largely be conducted in the Posit Cloud environment. Please create a login to the Posit Cloud instance of this workshop here:

[Posit Cloud Medical Cleaning Workshop](https://posit.cloud/content/5758558).

If you will not be using the Posit Cloud instance, you can just watch along as the instructors teach.

As a more high-risk alternative, if you would like to try this out on your own computer, please have the following installed and configured on your machine. Note that we will **NOT** be able to help you with local computer problems during the workshop. If you choose to do this, you are on your own.

-   Recent version of **R**

-   Recent version of **RStudio**

-   Recent version of packages used in this workshop.

    ``` r
    instll_pkgs <- c("tidyverse", "tidyxl", "unpivotr", "readxl", "openxlsx", "janitor", "gtsummary", "here", "padr")
    install.packages(instll_pkgs)
    ```
-   Ensure you can knit R markdown documents

- Open RStudio and create a new Rmarkdown document

- Save the document and check you are able to knit it.

-   Ensure you can import data from a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to R

    -   Save a a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet in a known folder on your computer.
    -   Open RStudio install/load (library) the packages {readxl}
        ([link](https://readxl.tidyverse.org)) and {openxlsx}
        ([link](https://ycphs.github.io/openxlsx/))
    -   Import the data from the spreadsheet into R using the path to
        the correct folder with either package.
