## Description

Join this interactive workshop to learn what Quarto is and its impact on data
communication and sharing.

In this session, we will:

-   explore how Quarto seamlessly integrates code and text to create
    reproducible reports;

-   dive into real-world applications at the Washington State Department of
    Agriculture; and

-   learn and practice Quarto functionality through demonstrations and hands-on
    exercises covering static and dynamic outputs, markdown syntax, code chunk
    options, output theming, and parameters.

## Learning objectives

-   Learn what Quarto is and what you can use it for.

-   Learn how to weave code and text together to create a fully reproducible
    report.

-   Learn how to use parameters to create variations of a report.

## Is this workshop for me?

The workshop is designed for folks familiar with R Markdown who are interested in
using Quarto and unlocking the power of parameterized reports. If you're new to
Quarto, we recommend watching [Mine √áetinkaya-Rundel's 23-minute *Getting Started with
Quarto*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f3latmOhew) or [Tom Mock's 2-hour *Welcome to Quarto Workshop*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvi5uXQMvu4).
