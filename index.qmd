## Description

The [Intro to Quarto workshop](https://charlotte.quarto.pub/cascadia/)
takes you through the basics of authoring a reproducible report using
Quarto. This workshop builds on those concepts and teaches you how to
level up your reproducible reports by using parameters, conditional
content, conditional code execution, and custom styling sheets for HTML
and Microsoft Word formats. Additionally, you will learn how to render
all variations of a parameterized report at once using `quarto` and
`purrr`.

## Learning objectives

-   Understand what parameterized reporting is and when it is useful.
-   Convert a Quarto document into a parameterized template and render
    all variations.
-   Generate multiple format outputs from the same template using
    conditional content, conditional code execution, and custom styling.
