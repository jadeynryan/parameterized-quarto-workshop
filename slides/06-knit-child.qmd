# Child documents {.section}

## Generate dynamic contents with a "child" template

-   `knitr::knit_child()` and `knitr::knit_expand()` are functions from R Markdown that also work with Quarto

-   "child" document is a template, which is run with different parameters

-   "main" document includes the output from all the different iterations of the child document

## Do not run interactively!

Code chunks including [`knitr::knit_child()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/knitr/man/knit_child.html) are not supposed to be used interactively (see this [Stack Overflow response](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16847729) from the `knitr` developer Yihui
Xie). If run interactively, you will get an error similar to the one shown
below.

``` {.r}
Error in `purrr::map_chr()`:
‚Ñπ In index: 1.
Caused by error in `setwd()`:
! character argument expected
```
