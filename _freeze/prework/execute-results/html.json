Please create an account if\nyou don't yet have one.\n\nYou must be part of the CEDS Workshops Posit Cloud work space to access the\nproject linked below.\n\n[**https://posit.cloud/spaces/504211/content/8093007**](https://posit.cloud/spaces/504211/content/8093007){.uri}\n\n**Alternative**\n\nIf you are struggling with Posit Cloud or if you prefer to work locally, please\nhave the following installed and configured on your machine.\n\n-   Recent version of [**R**](https://cran.rstudio.com/),\n    [**RStudio**](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), and\n    [**Quarto**](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)\n\n-   Recent version of packages used in this workshop:\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    pkgs <- c(\"dplyr\", \"fs\", \"ggplot2\", \"here\", \"plotly\", \"purrr\", \"quarto\", \n              \"readr\", \"stringr\", \"janitor\", \"lubridate\", \"tidyr\", \"rmarkdown\",\n              \"knitr\")\n    \n    install.packages(pkgs)\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n-   Check that Quarto works on your computer:\n\n    1.  Open RStudio and create a new Quarto (`.qmd`) document.\n\n    2.  Save the document and check you are able to render it.\n\n-   Get the project on your machine (by default, downloads to desktop).\n    \n    Uncomment and use the `destdir` argument to choose a different location.\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    # install.packages(\"usethis\")\n    usethis::use_course(\n        \"https://github.com/jadeynryan/parameterized-quarto-workshop/raw/coa-ceds/exercises/ceds-quarto-exercises.zip\"\n        # , destdir = \"C:/Users/jryan/Documents/R/projects\"\n    )\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n## Quarto and `purrr` {#sec-quarto-purrr}\n\nIf you're new to Quarto, we recommend watching [Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel's\n23-minute *Getting Started with\nQuarto*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f3latmOhew) or [Tom Mock's 2-hour\n*Welcome to Quarto Workshop*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvi5uXQMvu4).\n\nIf you're new to `purrr`, we recommend watching this R-Ladies Baltimore\npresentation [*Make your R Code purr with\n`purrr`*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IewsPpjKElc) and reviewing Jenny\nBryan's [tutorial](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/) and\n[workshop](https://github.com/jennybc/row-oriented-workflows).\n",
