After the workshop, I encourage you to adapt the exercise template files and code to fit your own projects.\n\nThere are three ways for you to participate. Please complete the pre-work for whichever way you'd like to follow along **before the workshop**.\n\n## Follow along in the Posit Cloud\n\nThis workshop will largely be conducted in the [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/) environment. Posit Cloud allows us all to work in the exact same environment with the same version of R, R packages, and directory of files. Please create an account if you don't yet have one.\n\nLog in to the Posit Cloud instance of this workshop here:\n\n**[bit.ly/rladies-parameterized-quarto](https://bit.ly/rladies-parameterized-quarto)**.\n\n## Watch and listen\n\nIf you will not be using the Posit Cloud instance, you can learn by watching and listening. No pre-work needed for you. ðŸ˜Š\n\n## Follow along on your own computer\n\nAs a more high-risk alternative, if you would like to try this out on your own computer, please have the following installed and configured on your machine. Note that we will **NOT** be able to help you with local computer problems during the workshop. If you choose to do this, you are on your own.\n\n-   Recent version of **R**\n\n-   Recent version of **RStudio**\n\n-   Recent version of packages used in this workshop:\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    pkgs <- c(\"dplyr\", \"fs\", \"ggplot2\", \"here\", \"plotly\", \"purrr\", \"quarto\", \n              \"readr\", \"stringr\", \"janitor\", \"lubridate\", \"tidyr\", \"rmarkdown\",\n              \"knitr\")\n    \n    install.packages(pkgs)\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n-   Check that Quarto works on your computer:\n\n    1. Open RStudio and create a new Quarto (`.qmd`) document.\n\n    2. Save the document and check you are able to render it.\n\n-   Get the project on your machine.\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    # install.packages(\"usethis\")\n    usethis::use_course(\"https://github.com/jadeynryan/rladies-parameterized-quarto/raw/main/exercises/exercises.zip\")\n    ```\n    :::\n",
