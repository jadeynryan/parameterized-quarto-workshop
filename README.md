## Abstract

Tired of manually adjusting Quarto reports for different regions, time
periods, or clients? Dreaming of using just one template to generate
both interactive HTML and static Word/PDF versions of your reports?

Join our workshop to unlock the power of parameterized reporting with
Quarto and leave with your own template and examples to modify for your
own projects.

Get a sneak preview of what you‚Äôll learn by checking out the
[slides](https://jadeyryan.com/talks/2023-09-25_posit_parameterized-quarto/)
from my posit::conf(2023) talk.

Everyone is welcome to attend. If you‚Äôre new to Quarto, we recommend

Quarto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvi5uXQMvu4).
