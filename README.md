## Description

Join this interactive workshop to learn what Quarto is and its impact on data
communication and sharing. In this session, we will 1) explore how Quarto
seamlessly integrates code and text to create reproducible reports and
presentations; 2) dive into real-world applications at the Washington State
Department of Agriculture; and 3) learn and practice Quarto functionality
through demonstrations and hands-on exercises covering static and dynamic output
formats, markdown syntax, code chunk options, output styling, and parameters for
document variations.

This workshop will be great for folks familiar with RMarkdown who are interested
in using Quarto and unlocking the power of parameterized reports. If you're new
to Quarto, we recommend watching [Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel's *Getting Started with
Quarto*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f3latmOhew) or [Tom Mock's excellent
2-hour introduction to Quarto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvi5uXQMvu4).
