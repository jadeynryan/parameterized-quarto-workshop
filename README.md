## Abstract

Tired of manually adjusting Quarto reports for different regions, time
periods, or clients? Dreaming of using just one template to generate
both interactive HTML and static Word/PDF versions of your reports?

Join our workshop to unlock the power of parameterized reporting with
Quarto and leave with your own template and examples to modify for your
own projects.

Everyone is welcome to attend. 

If you’re new to Quarto, we recommend
watching [Tom Mock’s excellent 2-hour introduction to
Quarto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvi5uXQMvu4).

If you're new to {purrr}, we recommend watching this R-Ladies Baltimore presentation [*Make your R Code purr with purrr*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IewsPpjKElc) and Jenny Bryan's [tutorial](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/) and [workshop](https://github.com/jennybc/row-oriented-workflows).
