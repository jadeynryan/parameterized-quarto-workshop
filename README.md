The [Intro to Quarto workshop](https://charlotte.quarto.pub/cascadia/)
takes you through the basics of authoring a reproducible report using
Quarto. This workshop builds on those concepts and teaches you how to
level up your reproducible reports by using parameters, conditional
content, conditional code execution, and custom styling sheets for HTML
and Microsoft Word formats. Additionally, you will learn how to render
all variations of a parameterized report at once using `quarto` and
`purrr`.

Quarto seamlessly integrates code and text to create reproducible
reports and presentations; 2) dive into real-world applications at the
